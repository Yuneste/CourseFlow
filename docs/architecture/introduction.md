# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for CourseFlow, a multi-regional academic file organization platform serving students across North America (US, Canada) and Europe (EU, UK). It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, focusing on a minimal tech stack of 7 core components (including payment processing and internationalization) that deliver maximum value with minimal complexity.

This architecture prioritizes rapid development, maintainability, and exceptional user experience while supporting multiple languages, currencies, and academic systems across different regions.
