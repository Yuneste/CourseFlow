### Data Model
```typescript
study_sessions {

  started_at, ended_at, duration
  notes, goals_completed
}

annotations {
  id, user_id, file_id, page_number
  type, content, position
  color, created_at
}

flashcard_reviews {
  id, user_id, flashcard_id
  rating, reviewed_at
  next_review_date
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Document Rendering:** Fallback to download if render fails
2. **Data Loss:** Auto-save every 30 seconds
3. **Performance:** Pagination for large documents
4. **Motivation:** Don't over-gamify, focus on real value
