## Background Context

Students face digital file chaos with cryptic naming conventions and disorganized folders. While competitors like Notion require complex manual setup and Google Drive lacks intelligent organization, CourseFlow combines automatic AI-powered organization with collaborative learning in one simple web platform.

**Key Insight:** Students don't need desktop apps - they need their files organized quickly and intelligently. Modern browsers can access local folders, eliminating the need for complex desktop integration.
