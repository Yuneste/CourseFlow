# User Interface Design

## Design Philosophy
- **Clean & Focused:** Minimal UI that doesn't distract from studying
- **Instant Gratification:** Every action provides immediate visual feedback
- **Delightful Details:** Confetti on achievements, smooth transitions, micro-interactions
- **Academic Aesthetic:** Professional yet approachable, optimized for long study sessions
- **Culturally Aware:** UI adapts to regional preferences (date formats, color meanings)

## Localization UI/UX
- **Language Switcher:** Prominent in header, persists selection
- **RTL Support:** Ready for future Arabic/Hebrew expansion
- **Regional Icons:** Academic icons that resonate locally
- **Number Formatting:** Locale-specific (1,000 vs 1.000)
- **Academic Terms:** Dynamic labels ("GPA" vs "Marks" vs "Notes")
