## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 implementation:
- Zustand store is already set up and working well for state management
- File upload components use Tailwind classes extensively
- Dashboard structure uses tabbed interface pattern
- Rate limiting and error handling patterns established

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: During Story 1.3 implementation, several UI/design improvements were made that actually belong to this story (1.4):
- Course Card styling with Linear-inspired design (semi-transparent backgrounds, backdrop blur)
- Sidebar improvements with better contrast and hover states
- Dashboard UI enhancements with animations and gradient accents
- Removal of dark backgrounds in favor of light, clean interfaces
- Implementation of the brand color #FA8072 throughout components

These changes were made prematurely but align with the goals of this story. This story should formalize and extend these UI improvements into a complete design system.

### UI Component Requirements
Based on Epic 1.4 requirements, the following components are needed:
- Navigation bar with user menu
- Sidebar for course filtering  
- Card components for files/courses
- Modal/dialog system
- Form components with validation
- Empty states with helpful messages

### Tech Stack Details
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ - Utility-first CSS for rapid styling
- **UI Component Library**: Shadcn/ui Latest - Beautiful, accessible components for rapid UI development
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.1+ with TypeScript 5.3+
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.5+ (already implemented)

### Project Structure for UI Components
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
```
components/                 # React components
├── ui/                     # Shadcn/ui components

    ├── Sidebar.tsx
    └── Header.tsx
```

### Component Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- Components should be in `components/` directory
- Shadcn/ui components go in `components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components in `components/features/{feature}/`
- Layout components in `components/layouts/`
- All components must use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Components should accept className prop for styling flexibility

### Coding Standards for Components
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase naming (e.g., `FileCard.tsx`)
- **Type Sharing**: All shared types must be defined in the types/ directory
- **State Updates**: Always use immutable updates with Zustand
- **Error Handling**: All components should handle loading and error states

### Theme Configuration Requirements
- Primary brand color: #FA8072 (Salmon) - already used in existing components
- Support both light and dark modes
- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Use CSS variables for theme values to enable runtime switching

### Existing Component Patterns
From implemented stories:
- Card component pattern used in FileCard and CourseCard
- Form patterns established in CourseForm
- Loading states implemented in FileUpload
- Error handling patterns in file upload components

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Component tests go in `__tests__/unit/components/`
- Use @testing-library/react for component testing
- Test files should be named `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`
- Must test all user interactions and state changes
- Mock external dependencies

### Responsive Design Requirements
- Desktop-first approach as specified
- Breakpoints to support: mobile (640px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+)
- Touch-friendly interactions for mobile
- Ensure all interactive elements meet minimum size requirements (44x44px)

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators must be visible and clear
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- All form inputs must have associated labels
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with inputs

### Performance Requirements
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.8s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.8s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Implement code splitting at route level
- Images should use next/image for automatic optimization

### Monitoring Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics - Performance monitoring built into platform
- **Logging**: Vercel Logs - Centralized logging automatic with Vercel
- Error tracking should use Sentry for production error monitoring

### File Locations
New files to be created:
- `components/ui/` - Shadcn/ui components
- `components/layouts/Header.tsx` - Navigation bar component
- `components/layouts/Sidebar.tsx` - Course filtering sidebar (already exists, may need updates)
- `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Loading skeleton component
- `app/providers.tsx` - Theme provider setup
- `lib/utils/toast.ts` - Toast helper functions
- `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Global error boundary
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Update with custom theme
- `components/accessibility/` - Accessibility components (skip links, announcements)
- `components/performance/` - Performance components (lazy load, virtual scroll)
- `components/feedback/` - User feedback components (progress, confirmations)
- `components/seo/` - SEO components (meta, structured data)
- `components/security/` - Security UI components
- `lib/monitoring/` - Monitoring integration helpers
- `__tests__/unit/components/` - Component tests

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test file locations:**
- Unit tests: `__tests__/unit/components/`
- Use @testing-library/react for component testing
- Use Vitest 1.2+ as testing framework

**Testing patterns to follow:**
```typescript
// Component test example
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should handle user interactions', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**Required test coverage:**
- Theme toggle functionality
- Loading states and skeletons
- Error boundary behavior
- Responsive breakpoints
- Toast notification display
- Form validation behavior
- Accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
