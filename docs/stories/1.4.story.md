## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 implementation:
- Zustand store is already set up and working well for state management
- File upload components use Tailwind classes extensively
- Dashboard structure uses tabbed interface pattern
- Rate limiting and error handling patterns established

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: During Story 1.3 implementation, several UI/design improvements were made that actually belong to this story (1.4):
- Course Card styling with Linear-inspired design (semi-transparent backgrounds, backdrop blur)
- Sidebar improvements with better contrast and hover states
- Dashboard UI enhancements with animations and gradient accents
- Removal of dark backgrounds in favor of light, clean interfaces
- Implementation of the brand color #FA8072 throughout components

These changes were made prematurely but align with the goals of this story. This story should formalize and extend these UI improvements into a complete design system.

### UI Component Requirements
Based on Epic 1.4 requirements, the following components are needed:
- Navigation bar with user menu
- Sidebar for course filtering  
- Card components for files/courses
- Modal/dialog system
- Form components with validation
- Empty states with helpful messages

- Components should be in `components/` directory
- Shadcn/ui components go in `components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components in `components/features/{feature}/`
- Layout components in `components/layouts/`
- All components must use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Components should accept className prop for styling flexibility

### Coding Standards for Components
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase naming (e.g., `FileCard.tsx`)
- **Type Sharing**: All shared types must be defined in the types/ directory
- **State Updates**: Always use immutable updates with Zustand
- **Error Handling**: All components should handle loading and error states

### Theme Configuration Requirements
- Primary brand color: #FA8072 (Salmon) - already used in existing components
- Support both light and dark modes
- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Use CSS variables for theme values to enable runtime switching

### Existing Component Patterns
From implemented stories:
- Card component pattern used in FileCard and CourseCard
- Form patterns established in CourseForm
- Loading states implemented in FileUpload
- Error handling patterns in file upload components

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Component tests go in `__tests__/unit/components/`
- Use @testing-library/react for component testing
- Test files should be named `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`
- Must test all user interactions and state changes
- Mock external dependencies

### Responsive Design Requirements
- Desktop-first approach as specified
- Breakpoints to support: mobile (640px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+)
- Touch-friendly interactions for mobile
- Ensure all interactive elements meet minimum size requirements (44x44px)

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators must be visible and clear
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- All form inputs must have associated labels
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with inputs

### Performance Requirements
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.8s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.8s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Implement code splitting at route level
- Images should use next/image for automatic optimization

### Monitoring Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics - Performance monitoring built into platform
- **Logging**: Vercel Logs - Centralized logging automatic with Vercel
- Error tracking should use Sentry for production error monitoring

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall implementation is comprehensive and production-ready. The UI component system has been successfully established with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components, and proper theme management. The implementation follows modern React patterns and includes extensive accessibility, performance, and security features as required.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx
  - **Change**: Added proper ARIA labels and current theme state display
  - **Why**: The component lacked accessibility context for screen readers
  - **How**: Added aria-label with current theme state, aria-haspopup attribute, and visual indicators for selected theme

- **File**: components/monitoring/PerformanceMonitoring.tsx
  - **Change**: Made performance monitoring opt-in by default and optimized memory monitoring
  - **Why**: Continuous requestAnimationFrame usage impacts performance when always active
  - **How**: Added enabled flag defaulting to false, reduced memory check frequency to 5s, and used Navigation Timing API v2

- **File**: components/performance/VirtualList.tsx
  - **Change**: Optimized item offset calculations with memoization
  - **Why**: O(n) calculations on every render for large lists caused performance issues
  - **How**: Pre-calculated and memoized item offsets array, reducing repeated calculations

- **File**: components/security/SessionTimeout.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed memory leaks and improved event handler performance
  - **Why**: Event listeners weren't properly throttled and could cause memory leaks
  - **How**: Added throttling to activity detection, reduced event types, added passive listeners, and prevented activity resets during warning countdown

- **File**: __tests__/unit/components/ui-components.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive tests for ThemeToggle component
  - **Why**: Critical UI component lacked test coverage
  - **How**: Added tests for rendering, interaction, and accessibility attributes with proper mocking

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All components follow PascalCase naming, proper TypeScript interfaces, and project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in ui/, features/, security/, performance/, etc.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests present with @testing-library/react, though coverage could be expanded
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 13 acceptance criteria have been implemented

### Improvements Checklist
