### Data Models
File data structure [Source: architecture/data-models.md#file]:
```typescript
interface File {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  course_id?: string;
  original_name: string;
  display_name: string;
  storage_url: string;
  file_type: string;
  file_size: number;
  file_hash: string; // SHA-256 hash for deduplication
  upload_source: 'web' | 'mobile' | 'api';
  is_academic_content: boolean; // Always true for MVP
  detected_language?: string;
  ai_category?: 'lecture' | 'assignment' | 'notes' | 'exam' | 'other'; // Pattern-based, not AI
  created_at: Date;
  processed_at?: Date;
  upload_session_id?: string; // For resumable uploads
}
```

Database schema for files table [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#sql-schema-definition]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  original_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  storage_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
  file_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- SHA-256 hash
  upload_source TEXT CHECK (upload_source IN ('web', 'mobile', 'api')),
  is_academic_content BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  detected_language TEXT,
  ai_category TEXT CHECK (ai_category IN ('lecture', 'assignment', 'notes', 'exam', 'other')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  upload_session_id TEXT,
  UNIQUE(user_id, file_hash) -- Prevent same user uploading identical files
);

-- Upload analytics table
CREATE TABLE upload_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_id UUID REFERENCES files(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  upload_status TEXT CHECK (upload_status IN ('started', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')),
  file_type TEXT,
  file_size BIGINT,
  upload_duration_ms INTEGER,
  error_reason TEXT,
  client_info JSONB, -- browser, OS, connection type
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Row Level Security policies needed:
- Enable RLS on files table
- Policy: Users can only SELECT their own files (user_id = auth.uid())
- Policy: Users can only INSERT files for themselves (user_id = auth.uid())
- Policy: Users can only UPDATE their own files (user_id = auth.uid())
- Policy: Users can only DELETE their own files (user_id = auth.uid())

### API Specifications
API routes structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
```
app/api/files/
├── route.ts              # GET /api/files
└── upload/
    └── route.ts          # POST /api/files/upload
```

File storage service details [Source: architecture/components.md#file-storage-service]:
- Technology: Supabase Storage with S3-compatible API
- Bucket structure: user-files/{user_id}/{course_id?}/{filename}
- Direct browser uploads supported
- Resumable uploads for large files
- Access control via Supabase RLS

### Component Specifications
Component organization [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
```
components/features/files/    # File-specific components
├── FileUpload.tsx           # Main upload component
├── UploadProgress.tsx       # Progress tracking
├── FileCard.tsx            # File display card
└── FileList.tsx            # File listing component
```

Service layer pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#service-example]:
```typescript
// lib/services/files.service.ts
import { api } from '@/lib/api/client';
import type { File } from '@/types';

export const filesService = {
  async upload(files: File[], courseId?: string, onProgress?: (progress: number) => void) {
    const formData = new FormData();
    files.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file));
    if (courseId) formData.append('course_id', courseId);
    
    // Implementation with XMLHttpRequest for progress tracking
    return new Promise<File[]>((resolve, reject) => {
      const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      
      xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress', (e) => {
        if (e.lengthComputable && onProgress) {
          const progress = (e.loaded / e.total) * 100;
          onProgress(progress);
        }
      });
      
      xhr.onload = () => {
        if (xhr.status === 200) {
          resolve(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
        } else {
          reject(new Error(xhr.statusText));
        }
      };
      
      xhr.open('POST', '/api/files/upload');
      xhr.send(formData);
    });
  },
  
  async getFiles(courseId?: string) {
    const query = courseId ? `?course_id=${courseId}` : '';
    return api.get<File[]>(`/files${query}`);
  },
  
  async deleteFile(id: string) {
    return api.delete(`/files/${id}`);
  }
};
```

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_create_files_table.sql` - Database migration
- `app/api/files/route.ts` - GET files endpoint
- `app/api/files/upload/route.ts` - POST file upload endpoint
- `components/features/files/FileUpload.tsx` - Upload component
- `components/features/files/UploadProgress.tsx` - Progress component
- `components/features/files/FileCard.tsx` - File display card
- `components/features/files/FileList.tsx` - File listing
- `lib/services/files.service.ts` - File service layer
- `lib/utils/file-validation.ts` - Validation utilities
- `lib/storage/upload.ts` - Storage helper functions
- `stores/useAppStore.ts` - Update with file state
- `types/index.ts` - Add File interface

### Testing Requirements
Testing framework and structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Use Vitest 1.2+ for unit testing
- Test files location: `__tests__/unit/` for unit tests
- File-specific tests should go in:
  - `__tests__/unit/components/FileUpload.test.tsx`
  - `__tests__/unit/api/files-upload.test.ts`
  - `__tests__/unit/services/files.service.test.ts`
  - `__tests__/unit/utils/file-validation.test.ts`
- Mock Supabase Storage client for testing
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking in component tests

### Technical Constraints
Required technology versions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- TypeScript 5.3+
- Next.js 14.1+
- Supabase Storage (via Supabase JS Client 2.39+)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Shadcn/ui components
- Zustand 4.5+ for state management
- Vitest 1.2+ for testing

Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Always validate file type and size on both client and server
- Never make direct fetch calls from components - use service layer
- Every API route must verify authentication before processing
- Use FormData for file uploads, not base64 encoding
- Chunk large file uploads for better reliability
- Always clean up failed uploads from storage

### File Upload Specifications
Supported file types for MVP:
- **Documents**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx, .doc), PowerPoint (.pptx, .ppt)
- **Images**: JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg), PNG (.png), GIF (.gif), WebP (.webp)
- **Text**: Plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md)
- **Spreadsheets**: Excel (.xlsx, .xls), CSV (.csv)

File size limits:
- Maximum file size: 50MB per file (MVP limit)
- Maximum upload batch: 10 files at once
- Total storage quota per tier:
  - Free: 50MB total
  - Student: 5GB total
  - Premium: 50GB total

Upload behavior:
- Show preview thumbnails for images
- Display file type icon for documents
- Validate before upload starts
- Support drag-and-drop from file explorer
- Support folder selection (maintain structure in metadata)
- Queue multiple files for sequential upload
- Allow cancellation of in-progress uploads

### Error Handling Scenarios
Specific error cases to handle:
- **File too large**: Show clear message with size limit
- **Unsupported file type**: List supported formats
- **Network failure**: Retry with exponential backoff
- **Storage quota exceeded**: Show upgrade prompt
- **Auth token expired**: Refresh and retry
- **Concurrent upload limit**: Queue excess files

### Security Considerations
- Validate MIME types on server, not just extensions
- Scan file headers to verify actual file type
- Generate unique storage paths: `user-files/{user_id}/{timestamp}-{random}-{filename}`
- Set proper CORS headers for storage bucket
- Implement virus scanning for uploaded files (post-MVP)
- Never expose direct storage URLs without auth

### Performance Optimization
- Use Web Workers for large file processing
- Implement chunked uploads for files >10MB
- Show accurate progress using XMLHttpRequest
- Lazy load file previews in gallery
- Use virtual scrolling for large file lists
- Cache file metadata in Zustand store

### Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation for file selection
- Screen reader announcements for upload progress
- High contrast mode for drop zone
- Clear focus indicators on interactive elements
- Alternative text for file type icons

### Browser Compatibility
- File API: All modern browsers
- Drag and drop: All modern browsers
- Folder selection: Chrome/Edge (webkitdirectory)
- Fallback: Traditional file input for older browsers
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Production Enhancement: Resumable Uploads
Implementation using TUS protocol [Source: https://tus.io/]:
- Use `@supabase/storage-js` resumable upload feature
- Store upload sessions in localStorage with metadata:
  ```typescript
  interface UploadSession {
    id: string;
    fileHash: string;
    uploadUrl: string;
    bytesUploaded: number;
    totalBytes: number;
    expiresAt: Date;
  }
  ```
- Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- Resume interrupted uploads on page reload
- Clean up expired sessions after 24 hours


### Production Enhancement: Client-Side Image Optimization
**Automatic processing before upload:**
```typescript
interface ImageOptimizationOptions {
  maxWidth: 2048;
  maxHeight: 2048;
  quality: 0.85;
  format: 'jpeg' | 'webp';
  stripMetadata: true;
}
```
- HEIC to JPEG conversion using heic2any library
- Resize images maintaining aspect ratio
- Progressive JPEG encoding for faster preview
- Generate 200x200 thumbnail for grid views
- Remove EXIF data including GPS coordinates
- Estimated savings: 60-80% file size reduction

### Production Enhancement: Duplicate Detection
**Hash-based deduplication system:**
- Calculate SHA-256 hash using Web Crypto API
- Check hash before upload: `GET /api/files/check-duplicate?hash={hash}`
- If duplicate found:
  - Show existing file preview
  - Offer to link to existing file
  - Display space saved message
- Track deduplication metrics:
  - Total duplicates prevented
  - Storage space saved
  - Most duplicated files

### Production Enhancement: Upload Analytics
**Comprehensive monitoring system:**
```typescript
interface UploadMetrics {
  userId: string;
  fileType: string;
  fileSize: number;
  uploadDuration: number;
  uploadSpeed: number; // bytes/second
  networkType: 'wifi' | '4g' | '3g' | 'slow-2g';
  browser: string;
  errorReason?: string;
  retryCount: number;
}
```
- Real-time dashboard showing:
  - Success rate by file type
  - Average upload speed by region
  - Peak upload times
  - Common failure reasons
- Alerts for:
  - Success rate < 95%
  - Average speed < 1MB/s
  - Spike in specific error types


### Production Enhancement: Security Hardening
**Advanced security measures:**
- Magic bytes validation:
  ```typescript
  const FILE_SIGNATURES = {
    pdf: [0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46], // %PDF
    png: [0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47], // PNG
    jpg: [0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF], // JPEG
    // ... more signatures
  };
  ```
- Content Security Policy headers:
  ```typescript
  response.headers.set(
    'Content-Security-Policy',
    "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' blob: data:; script-src 'self'"
  );
  ```
- Rate limiting by file type:
  - Images: 10 per minute
  - Documents: 20 per minute
  - Total: 30 per minute
- Malware scanning preparation:
  - Quarantine uploads until scanned
  - Integration point for ClamAV or similar
  - Async scanning with webhook notification

### Production Enhancement: Batch Processing
**Efficient queue management:**
```typescript
interface UploadQueue {
  pending: UploadItem[];
  active: UploadItem[];
  completed: UploadItem[];
  failed: UploadItem[];
  
  maxConcurrent: 3;
  priorityRules: {
    smallFilesFirst: boolean;
    academicContentFirst: boolean;
  };
}
```
- Queue features:
  - Concurrent upload limit (3 files)
  - Priority for files < 5MB
  - Pause/resume entire queue
  - Retry failed uploads automatically
  - Clear completed items after 24h
- Post-upload processing queue:
  - AI categorization tasks
  - Thumbnail generation
  - Text extraction from PDFs
  - Full-text search indexing

### Production Enhancement: Developer Experience
**Tools for testing and development:**
- Mock file generator:
  ```typescript
  function generateMockFile(type: 'pdf' | 'image' | 'doc', size: number): File
  ```
- Upload simulator for testing:
  - Configurable network speeds
  - Failure injection
  - Progress simulation
- Storybook stories:
  - All upload states
  - Error scenarios
  - Progress variations
  - Mobile vs desktop views
- Performance benchmarks:
  - Time to first byte
  - Upload speed by file size
  - Memory usage during upload
  - CPU usage for image processing

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Testing requirements specific to this story [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

**Test file locations:**
- Unit tests: `__tests__/unit/`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/`
- Component tests use @testing-library/react
- API tests use supertest pattern with Vitest

**Required test coverage:**
- File validation functions must have 100% coverage
- Upload API endpoint must test all error scenarios
- Component tests must cover user interactions
- Mock all external services (Supabase Storage)

**Testing patterns to follow:**
```typescript
// Component test example
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

describe('FileUpload', () => {
  it('should accept valid file types', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should reject invalid file types', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

// API test example
describe('POST /api/files/upload', () => {
  it('should require authentication', async () => {
    // Test 401 response
  });
  
  it('should validate file size', async () => {
    // Test 400 response for large files
  });
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall, the implementation is solid and follows most best practices. The file upload infrastructure is well-architected with proper separation of concerns, good error handling, and comprehensive feature coverage. However, I identified several areas that needed improvement for production readiness, security, and performance.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: lib/utils/file-validation.ts
  - **Change**: Removed incorrect Node.js crypto import
  - **Why**: The code uses Web Crypto API (crypto.subtle) which is browser-compatible
  - **How**: Replaced with explanatory comment about Web Crypto API usage

- **File**: lib/utils/debounce.ts (NEW)
  - **Change**: Created debounce utility functions
  - **Why**: Duplicate checks were firing too frequently causing performance issues
  - **How**: Added standard and promise-based debounce functions for optimizing API calls

- **File**: components/features/files/FileUploadErrorBoundary.tsx (NEW)
  - **Change**: Created error boundary component
  - **Why**: File uploads can fail in various ways and crash the UI
  - **How**: Implements React error boundary with user-friendly error messages and recovery

- **File**: app/api/files/upload/route.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed AI processing queue comment and added file marking
  - **Why**: The comment about window object made no sense in server context
  - **How**: Added proper file marking for AI processing in database

- **File**: app/api/files/upload/route.ts
  - **Change**: Added security headers to response
  - **Why**: Missing important security headers for file upload endpoint
  - **How**: Added CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options headers

- **File**: lib/supabase/client-singleton.ts (NEW)
  - **Change**: Created singleton pattern for Supabase client
  - **Why**: Multiple client instances were being created causing connection overhead
  - **How**: Implemented singleton pattern with reset capability for testing

- **File**: lib/utils/tus-upload.ts
  - **Change**: Updated to use singleton Supabase client
  - **Why**: Consistency and performance improvement
  - **How**: Replaced createClient with getSupabaseClient from singleton

- **File**: __tests__/unit/utils/file-validation.test.ts
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive tests for validateMagicBytes
  - **Why**: Critical security feature was untested
  - **How**: Added tests for PDF, PNG, invalid bytes, and text file scenarios

- **File**: components/features/files/FileUploadWithDetection.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed memory leak in useEffect and added cleanup
  - **Why**: Component wasn't cleaning up properly on unmount
  - **How**: Added cleanup effect and fixed dependency array

- **File**: components/features/files/FileUploadWithDetection.tsx
  - **Change**: Added accessibility attributes
  - **Why**: Upload zone wasn't keyboard accessible
  - **How**: Added ARIA labels, role, and keyboard event handlers
