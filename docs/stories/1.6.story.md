## Dev Notes

### MVP Focus - What to Build First
**Priority Order for Profitability**:
1. **Cost Protection** (AC 12) - Build this FIRST to prevent bankruptcy
2. **Basic Stripe Integration** (AC 1-4) - Core payment flow
3. **Usage Tracking** (AC 5) - Monitor costs in real-time
4. **Trial/Free Tier Controls** - Prevent abuse
5. **Conversion Optimization** (AC 13) - Drive revenue

**Deferred Features** (marked with ~~strikethrough~~):
- Virus scanning (not critical for text files)
- Multiple payment methods (one card is enough)
- Email preferences (just send critical emails)
- Phone verification (too much friction)
- Subscription pause (nice to have)

**Keep It Simple**:
- Start with card payments only (add SEPA for Germany later)
- Use GPT-3.5 for everything initially
- Basic email templates only
- Manual admin tools can wait

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story insights available as this is the first payment-related story.

### Data Models
**Subscription Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Subscription]
```typescript
interface Subscription {

- Uses Stripe SDK with Next.js API routes
- Stores subscription data in PostgreSQL via Supabase

### File Locations
Based on PRD technical implementation and architecture structure:
- `app/pricing/page.tsx` - Pricing page with tiers
- `app/api/billing/[...routes]/route.ts` - Billing API endpoints
- `lib/stripe/client.ts` - Stripe client configuration
- `lib/subscriptions/limits.ts` - Subscription tier limits
- `components/UpgradePrompt.tsx` - Upgrade prompt component
- `components/UsageIndicator.tsx` - Usage indicator component

### Technical Constraints
- **Tech Stack**: Stripe (Latest version) for payment processing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ via Supabase [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.1+ API Routes [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Multi-currency**: Support USD, CAD, EUR, GBP [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Subscription]
- **Security**: All billing endpoints must verify authentication [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Security & Fraud Prevention Configuration
**Rate Limiting** (per IP address)
```typescript
// lib/security/billing-limits.ts
export const BILLING_RATE_LIMITS = {
  '/api/billing/create-checkout': '3 per 15 minutes',
  '/api/billing/portal': '5 per hour',
  '/api/billing/webhook': '100 per minute', // Stripe needs higher limit
  '/api/billing/usage': '60 per hour'
};
```

**Webhook Security**
```typescript
// Only accept webhooks from Stripe IPs
const STRIPE_WEBHOOK_IPS = [
  '3.18.12.63', '3.130.192.231', '13.235.14.237', '13.235.122.149',
  '18.211.135.69', '35.154.171.200', '52.15.183.38', '54.88.130.119',
  '54.88.130.237', '54.187.174.169', '54.187.205.235', '54.187.216.72'
];

// Webhook signature verification is MANDATORY
const sig = headers['stripe-signature'];
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, endpointSecret);
```

**Fraud Detection Rules**
- Block if: Same user tries >3 different cards in 24h
- Block if: Disposable email domain detected
- Block if: VPN/Proxy detected for payment (use ipapi.co)
- Alert if: User uploads >50 files in 1 hour
- Alert if: AI usage >10x daily average

### International Tax & Compliance
**VAT Rates for EU Operations**
```typescript
// Stripe Tax handles this automatically, but for reference:
const EU_VAT_RATES = {
  AT: 0.20, BE: 0.21, BG: 0.20, HR: 0.25, CY: 0.19,
  CZ: 0.21, DK: 0.25, EE: 0.20, FI: 0.24, FR: 0.20,
  DE: 0.19, GR: 0.24, HU: 0.27, IE: 0.23, IT: 0.22,
  LV: 0.21, LT: 0.21, LU: 0.17, MT: 0.18, NL: 0.21,
  PL: 0.23, PT: 0.23, RO: 0.19, SK: 0.20, SI: 0.22,
  ES: 0.21, SE: 0.25
};

// Configure Stripe for EU merchant
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, {
  apiVersion: '2023-10-16',
  maxNetworkRetries: 2,
  timeout: 10000 // 10 second timeout
});
```

**GDPR Compliance Checklist**
- [ ] Data Processing Agreement (DPA) signed with Stripe
- [ ] Privacy policy includes payment processing details
- [ ] User deletion also removes Stripe customer (via API)
- [ ] Payment data never logged in plaintext
- [ ] PII masked in logs (last 4 digits only)
- [ ] Implement data export for payment history

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location**: `__tests__/unit/api/billing/` for API tests
- **Test Framework**: Vitest 1.2+
- **Test Patterns**: 
  - Mock Stripe SDK responses
  - Test webhook signature verification
  - Verify subscription state transitions
  - Test usage limit enforcement logic

### Project Structure Notes
The current project structure shows:
- No existing `/api/billing/` directory yet - needs to be created
- No pricing page exists yet
- No Stripe-related components or libraries exist yet
This story will establish the entire payment infrastructure from scratch.

### Profitability Strategy & Target
**Goal**: €2000/month profit
**Target Users**: 200 Scholar + 40 Master = €3,000 revenue → €2,000 profit (67% margin)

**Unit Economics per User Type**:
| Tier | Revenue | Max AI Cost | Other Costs | Profit | Margin |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Explorer | €0 | €0.50 | €0.10 | -€0.60 | -∞% |
| Scholar | €10 | €4.00 | €1.00 | €5.00 | 50% |
| Master | €25 | €10.00 | €2.00 | €13.00 | 52% |

**Cost Controls**:
- AI costs capped at 40% of subscription revenue per user
- Automatic throttling and degradation near limits
- Hard stop at 100% of allocated budget
- Daily monitoring of cost anomalies

**Abuse Prevention**:
- IP-based account limits
- File deduplication
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Suspicious activity auto-suspension
- Free tier friction to prevent abuse

**Conversion Strategy**:
- Target 10% free→paid conversion
- 20% trial→paid conversion
- <5% monthly churn
- 80% Scholar→Master upgrade path

### OpenAI Cost Optimization Strategy
**Critical for Profitability**:
```typescript
// lib/ai/cost-optimizer.ts
export const AI_COST_OPTIMIZATION = {
  // Model selection by task
  modelSelection: {
    fileNaming: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',        // €0.0015/1K tokens
    basicSummary: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',      // €0.0015/1K tokens
    complexAnalysis: 'gpt-4-turbo',     // €0.01/1K tokens (only when needed)
    flashcards: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'         // €0.0015/1K tokens
  },
  
  // Token limits by feature
  tokenLimits: {
    summary: 500,        // ~€0.0008 per summary
    flashcards: 1000,    // ~€0.0015 per set
    categorization: 200  // ~€0.0003 per file
  },
  
  // Caching strategy
  caching: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
    similarity_threshold: 0.95 // Cache if 95% similar
  }
};
```

    // Mask sensitive data
  }
}
```
