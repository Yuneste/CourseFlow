# Story 1.2: Course Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Course Management System with full CRUD functionality, addressing all user feedback and deployment issues.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `courses` table with comprehensive fields (name, code, professor, credits, colors, emojis)
- Added `profiles` table with study program fields (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS to prevent errors)
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Added proper indexes and triggers

### 2. API Endpoints
- `/api/courses` - GET/POST with authentication and rate limiting
- `/api/courses/[id]` - GET/PATCH/DELETE with ownership validation
- `/api/profile` - PATCH for updating study program information
- Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute (in-memory implementation)
- Course limits: 100 total, 20 per term

### 3. Service Layer
- `coursesService` with full CRUD operations
- Proper error handling and validation
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 4. UI Components
- Enhanced onboarding flow with 4 steps:
  1. Country selection (US, CA, UK, DE, NL)
  2. Study program details (major, degree type, years)
  3. Course creation with edit/delete functionality
  4. Completion with animated benefits showcase
- Course management dashboard integration
- Grid/List view toggle
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 5. State Management
- Zustand store with persistence
- Course state management
- Profile state with study program info

### 6. Country-Specific Features
- Academic systems for 5 countries
- Localized term names (e.g., Wintersemester for Germany)
- Appropriate degree types per country
- Credit systems (ECTS, UK Honours, US Credits)

### 7. User Experience Improvements
- Animated 5-slide benefits showcase using Framer Motion
- Interactive course cards (click to edit)
- Consistent list view width (max-w-md)
- Removed email from welcome message
- Smooth transitions and loading states

## Technical Decisions
- Used Supabase for database and authentication
- Implemented in-memory rate limiting (not Redis) for simplicity
- Created reusable service layer pattern
- Used Framer Motion for animations
- TypeScript with strict typing throughout

## SQL Migrations Required
```bash
# Run these in order:
1. supabase/migrations/20250127_create_courses_table.sql
2. supabase/migrations/20250127_add_study_program_fields.sql
```

## Testing
- 34 unit tests covering authentication flows
- Manual testing of all CRUD operations
- Verified country-specific functionality
- Tested rate limiting and validation

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to Vercel
- All build errors resolved
- TypeScript compilation passing
- No ESLint errors

## Future Enhancements
- Add course scheduling features
- Implement grade tracking
- Add file attachments to courses
- Create course analytics dashboard
- Add collaborative features
