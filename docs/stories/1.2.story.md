### Data Models
Course data structure [Source: architecture/data-models.md#course]:
```typescript
interface Course {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  name: string;
  code?: string;
  professor?: string;
  term: string;
  academic_period_type: 'semester' | 'term' | 'trimester';
  credits?: number;
  ects_credits?: number;
  color: string;
  emoji?: string;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

Database schema for courses table [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#sql-schema-definition]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  code TEXT,
  professor TEXT,
  term TEXT NOT NULL,
  academic_period_type TEXT CHECK (academic_period_type IN ('semester', 'term', 'trimester')),
  credits INTEGER, -- US/Canada credits
  ects_credits INTEGER, -- European ECTS
  color TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '#3B82F6',
  emoji TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Row Level Security policies needed:
- Enable RLS on courses table
- Policy: Users can only SELECT their own courses (user_id = auth.uid())
- Policy: Users can only INSERT courses for themselves (user_id = auth.uid())
- Policy: Users can only UPDATE their own courses (user_id = auth.uid())
- Policy: Users can only DELETE their own courses (user_id = auth.uid())

### API Specifications
API routes structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
```
app/api/courses/
├── route.ts        # GET, POST /api/courses
└── [id]/
    └── route.ts    # GET, PUT, DELETE /api/courses/[id]
```

REST API patterns [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rest-api-specification]:
- All endpoints require authentication via Supabase session
- Use consistent error response format
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Validate input on server side

### Component Specifications
Component organization [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
```
components/features/courses/    # Course-specific components
├── CourseCard.tsx
├── CourseForm.tsx
├── CourseList.tsx
└── CourseDetails.tsx

app/(dashboard)/                # Protected dashboard routes
├── dashboard/
│   └── page.tsx               # Main dashboard with course grid

    ├── page.tsx               # Onboarding wizard
    └── layout.tsx             # Wizard layout wrapper
```

State management with Zustand [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
```typescript
// stores/useAppStore.ts
interface AppState {
  // User state
  user: User | null;
  
  // Course state
  courses: Course[];
  selectedCourse: Course | null;
  isLoadingCourses: boolean;
  
  // Course actions

  updateCourse: (id: string, updates: Partial<Course>) => void;
  deleteCourse: (id: string) => void;
  setSelectedCourse: (course: Course | null) => void;
}
```

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Onboarding wizard main page
- `app/onboarding/layout.tsx` - Wizard layout wrapper
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard with course grid
- `app/api/courses/route.ts` - GET, POST course endpoints
- `app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts` - PUT, DELETE course endpoints
- `components/features/courses/CourseCard.tsx` - Course card component
- `components/features/courses/CourseForm.tsx` - Course creation/edit form
- `components/features/courses/CourseList.tsx` - Course list/grid component
- `lib/services/courses.service.ts` - Course service layer
- `stores/useAppStore.ts` - Global state management
- `types/index.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

### Testing Requirements
Testing framework and structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Use Vitest 1.2+ for unit testing
- Test files location: `__tests__/unit/` for unit tests
- Course-specific tests should go in:
  - `__tests__/unit/components/CourseForm.test.tsx`
  - `__tests__/unit/api/courses.test.ts`
  - `__tests__/unit/services/courses.service.test.ts`
- Use `@testing-library/react` for component testing
- Mock Supabase client for testing

Example test structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-component-test]:
```typescript
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

describe('CourseForm', () => {
  it('should create a new course', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Technical Constraints
Required technology versions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- TypeScript 5.3+
- Next.js 14.1+
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Shadcn/ui (already installed)
- Zustand 4.5+ for state management
- Supabase JS Client 2.39+
- Vitest 1.2+ for testing

Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- All shared types must be defined in the types/ directory
- Never make direct fetch calls from components - always use the service layer
- Access environment variables only through validated config objects
- Every API route must verify authentication before processing
- Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- Use snake_case for database tables and columns

Service layer pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#service-example]:
```typescript
// lib/services/courses.service.ts
import { api } from '@/lib/api/client';
import type { Course } from '@/types';

export const coursesService = {
  async getCourses() {
    return api.get<Course[]>('/courses');
  },
  
  async createCourse(course: Partial<Course>) {
    return api.post<Course>('/courses', course);
  },
  
  async updateCourse(id: string, updates: Partial<Course>) {
    return api.put<Course>(`/courses/${id}`, updates);
  },
  
  async deleteCourse(id: string) {
    return api.delete(`/courses/${id}`);
  }
};
```

### Regional Academic Systems
Based on supported regions [Source: architecture/localization-architecture.md#supported-regions-languages]:
- **North America (US/Canada)**: 
  - Terms: Fall, Spring, Summer semesters
  - Academic year: August/September - May
  - GPA system for grades
- **UK**:
  - Terms: Michaelmas, Hilary/Lent, Trinity
  - Academic year: October - June
  - UK Honours system for grades
- **Germany**:
  - Terms: Wintersemester (Oct-Mar), Sommersemester (Apr-Sep)
  - ECTS credit system
- **Netherlands**:
  - Terms: Period/Block system (4-6 blocks per year)
  - ECTS credit system

The user's country selection during onboarding should:
1. Set appropriate term options in course creation
2. Configure the correct academic period type
3. Update user profile with country and academic_system

Country detection alternatives:
- Use browser's navigator.language for initial guess
- IP-based geolocation (requires additional service)
- Manual selection during onboarding (recommended for accuracy)

### Form Validation Rules
Course field validation requirements:
- **Course name**: Required, 2-100 characters, allow letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and parentheses
- **Course code**: Optional, max 20 characters, format examples: "CS101", "MATH-200", "BIO 303L"
- **Professor name**: Optional, max 100 characters, letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes
- **Term**: Required, must match user's academic system options
- **Color**: Optional, limited to predefined palette of 12 colors for consistency
- **Emoji**: Optional, limited to education-related emoji set

### Error Handling Scenarios
Specific error cases to implement:
- **Duplicate detection**: Prevent duplicate course name + term combinations
- **Network failures**: Show retry option with cached form data
- **Concurrent editing**: Use optimistic locking with version field
- **Course limits**: Maximum 20 courses per term, 100 total courses per user
- **Graceful degradation**: Queue failed requests for retry when online

### Performance Considerations
- **Large course lists**: Implement virtual scrolling for >50 courses
- **Form inputs**: Debounce validation by 300ms
- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI immediately, rollback on API failure
- **Lazy loading**: Load full course details only when card is expanded
- **Caching**: Cache course list in Zustand with 5-minute TTL

### Data Migration & Defaults
- **Smart term selection**: Auto-select current academic term based on:
  - User's region and current date
  - Most recently used term if within valid range
- **Existing users**: Migration script to set academic_system based on country
- **Fallback**: If country not set, prompt during first course creation

### Security Considerations
- **Input sanitization**: Strip HTML/script tags from all text inputs
- **Rate limiting**: Max 10 course creations per minute per user
- **Field lengths**: Enforce maximum lengths in both frontend and API
- **SQL injection**: Use parameterized queries (Supabase handles this)

### UX Polish Details
- **Empty states**: 
  - New user: "Welcome! Let's add your first course"
  - No courses in term: "No courses for this term yet"
- **Tooltips**: 
  - Course code: "e.g., CS101, MATH-200 (optional)"
  - Color: "Choose a color to organize your courses"
- **Smart defaults**:
  - Pre-select current/upcoming term
  - Default color cycles through palette
- **Delete confirmation**: "Delete [Course Name]? This won't delete your files."

### Internationalization Prep
- **Term storage**: Store term as `{year}_{period_type}` (e.g., "2024_fall", "2024_wintersemester")
- **Display names**: Use i18n keys for term display names
- **Date formats**: Format term dates according to user's locale
- **RTL support**: Use logical CSS properties (margin-inline-start vs margin-left)
- **Emoji**: Ensure emoji render correctly across different OS/browsers

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Color contrast**: Ensure 4.5:1 ratio for text on course card backgrounds
- **Alternative identification**: Add patterns or icons in addition to colors
- **Focus indicators**: Clear focus rings on all interactive elements
- **Error announcements**: Use aria-live regions for form errors

### Project Structure Notes
The project follows the established structure from architecture/unified-project-structure.md. All new files should be placed in their designated locations according to the structure guide. The onboarding flow will be a new addition under app/onboarding/, while course management components will go under components/features/courses/.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `__tests__/unit/` for unit tests, organized by type:
  - `__tests__/unit/components/` for React component tests
  - `__tests__/unit/api/` for API route tests
  - `__tests__/unit/services/` for service layer tests
- Testing framework: Vitest 1.2+ with @testing-library/react
- Mock Supabase client for unit tests using vi.mock()
- Test coverage requirements:
  - All API routes must have tests for success and error cases
  - Component tests should cover user interactions and state changes
  - Service layer tests should verify proper API calls
- Follow the testing patterns defined in architecture/testing-strategy.md
- Use proper test isolation - each test should be independent
- Test naming convention: describe blocks for components/functions, it blocks for specific behaviors

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the Course Management System is excellent overall. The developer has created a comprehensive solution that properly handles all acceptance criteria with appropriate security measures, validation, and user experience considerations. The code follows modern React patterns, implements proper TypeScript typing, and maintains good separation of concerns.

### Post-Implementation Review Date: 2025-07-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Post-Implementation Assessment

After recent changes to fix routing and onboarding flow issues, I've performed a comprehensive review of the current implementation. The changes have significantly improved the user experience and fixed critical issues.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts
  - **Change**: Added rate limiting to PUT endpoint
  - **Why**: The PUT endpoint was missing rate limit protection while POST had it
  - **How**: Added consistent rate limiting (30 requests per minute) to prevent abuse of update operations

- **File**: stores/useAppStore.ts
  - **Change**: Added cache expiry mechanism with `coursesLastFetched` timestamp and `shouldRefetchCourses` utility
  - **Why**: To prevent stale data and reduce unnecessary API calls
  - **How**: Tracks when courses were last fetched and provides a method to check if cache is stale (5 minutes)

- **File**: lib/utils.ts
  - **Change**: Added `useDebounce` hook
  - **Why**: To improve form validation performance and reduce unnecessary re-renders
  - **How**: Generic debounce hook that can be used for input validation delays

- **File**: __tests__/unit/api/courses.test.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed Supabase mock imports and added missing test cases
  - **Why**: Tests were using incorrect import name and missing critical validation tests
  - **How**: Updated all imports to use `createClient` and added tests for duplicate courses and field validation

### Post-Implementation Changes Review

**Critical Issues Fixed:**

1. **Onboarding Flow Persistence**
   - Added `onboarding_completed` flag to profiles table
   - Users who complete onboarding are now permanently marked
   - Deleting all courses no longer sends users back to onboarding
   - Migration properly handles existing users

2. **Profile Settings Persistence**
   - Fixed Study Program field not saving correctly
   - Added Degree Type field to profile settings
   - Profile updates now show success message and reload data
   - Both fields properly persist to database

3. **Routing Logic Improvements**
   - Simplified middleware to prevent redirect loops
   - Root URL (/) correctly shows landing for non-authenticated users
   - Authenticated users with completed onboarding go to dashboard
   - Onboarding page is protected and only accessible to authenticated fresh users

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Fixed apostrophe escaping in JSX for build compliance
   - Removed infinite redirect loops between settings and onboarding
   - Proper error handling when auth state is uncertain

**Code Quality Observations:**

- ✓ All routing logic is now clean and predictable
- ✓ Middleware is simplified and focused on core authentication checks
- ✓ Dashboard properly checks onboarding_completed flag
- ✓ Profile API route handles new onboarding_completed field
- ✓ Migration script ensures backward compatibility

**Testing Validation:**

- ✓ New user flow: Landing → Register → Onboarding → Dashboard
- ✓ Returning user flow: Landing → Login → Dashboard
- ✓ Profile persistence: Study Program and Degree Type save correctly
- ✓ Course deletion doesn't trigger re-onboarding
- ✓ No redirect loops in any navigation scenario

### Final Recommendation

✓ **APPROVED** - All acceptance criteria remain satisfied and the recent fixes have improved the overall stability and user experience. The onboarding flow is now truly a one-time experience for new users as intended.
